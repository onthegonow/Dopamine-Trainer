requirements:
Objective:  Create a mac os native app called "Dopamine Trainer :bicep-emoji:” which helps ADHD (and all) people train their reward function so they become less addicted to short term rewards. 

Primary User Stories/features:
- User feels an "urge" for stimulation and clicks a large button that says "urge"
     (this will usually be a stimulation seeking behavior such at desiring to surf or scroll or consume web content, a sugar craving or desire to eat sweet food, or a craving for masterbation or any other dopamine seeking behavior)
     - pressing the craving behavior kicks off a large timer function and adds the running timer to an active list view of similar timers
- User fulfills craving and clicks a smaller button that says "scratched the itch"
- User does not fulfill craving and clicks a medium sized button that says "beat it!"
- User cancels "urge" by swiping left on timer element and hitting garbage can icon (or some other confirmation)
- User does nothing for 24 hours and the timer is resolved and the urge entry is marked as "faded"
- User reviews list of urges from the past weeks in an infinite scrolling table with filters.  Columns:
     - Timestamp
     - (most primanant) Calculated time between urge and satsifaction of urge
     - Status of each urge entry: "Beat it" (green), "Satisfied"(light red), "Faded"

Components:
- taskbar view that consists of the dopamine molecule as the icon 
     - on click produces a dropdown menu of the stoplight of timer options available
